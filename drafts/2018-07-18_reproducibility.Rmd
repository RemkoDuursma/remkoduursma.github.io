- intro and reference to my reproducible manuscripts
- packages : pacman, minimize number packages used, avoid packages that are obviously 'in flux', only use packages on CRAN (where possible). Load ALL packages in one place, at the top of the workflow. 
- code organization: show my project structure. We can go more complex like this package, but I have not needed it.
- remake/makefile/that other new thing: very cool, yes. Especially when one component of the analysis takes a long time to complete. Otherwise: don't use when not needed.
- KISS.
- Manuscript: use rmarkdown not LaTeX unless you are suicidal
- References
- Collaborating with non-programmers: rmarkdown is OK but we have to add changes into the manuscript manually
