      <description>We discussed a paper in journal club today (Tan et al. 2017), where three outliers were removed from a plot with just seven data points. The authors were happy to report a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.99. Here is their Fig. 2b (doesn’t matter what’s on the axes), where ‘outliers’ were labelled with open symbols.
What value of r do we expect between two normally distributed variables (where n=7), when we remove three points so that r is maximal?</description>
