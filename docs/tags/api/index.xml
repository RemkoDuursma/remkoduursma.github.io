      <description>I recently had the pleasure to complete an assessment - as part of a job interview. The assessment was enjoyable exactly because I did not have much - if any - experience with what I was supposed to be assessed on. But, at least for me, thatâ€™s the point: how quick can we learn new tools in the data science toolkit?
Unfortunately I am not going to share the actual assessment (or even some part of it), but will talk about the plumber package which I used to deploy an API.</description>
