      <description>As a child, I loved playing Jumbojet (from the publisher Jumbo) - basically a Monopoly knock-off but with quite a few changes. Recently my son and I found a pristine copy of this 1975 game in a second-hand store, and it made me all nostalgic.
I might write more about the game later- as I am working on a simulator - but here just want to think about dice. What good probability problem doesn’t have dice in it?</description>

      <description>The game of Pirate Plank. My 6yr-old wins most of the time. Why?
There are some benefits to being unemployed - I have the time to figure out the best strategy at a board game I like to play with my 6 year old. The game is Pirate Plank, made by LEGO, and it is interesting because there’s some decision making involved.
The game starts with each of the pirates at the start of a plank, and an empty die.</description>
