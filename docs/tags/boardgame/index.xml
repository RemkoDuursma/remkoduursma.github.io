      <description>As a child, I loved playing Jumbojet (from the publisher Jumbo) - basically a Monopoly knock-off but with quite a few changes. Recently my son and I found a pristine copy of this 1975 game in a second-hand store, and it made me all nostalgic.
I might write more about the game later- as I am working on a simulator - but here just want to think about dice. What good probability problem doesnâ€™t have dice in it?</description>
