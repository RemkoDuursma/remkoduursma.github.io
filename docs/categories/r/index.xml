      <description>How do petrol prices vary across the state?The price of fuel at service stations varies tremendously, both in space - across the large Australian state of New South Wales, and time - with surprising patterns. In this post I begin my quest to understand how fuel price varies, what factors explain its fluctuation over time and spatial variation. Obviously it would be nice to be able to know where to drive for cheaper fuel (what kind of areas are cheaper?</description>

      <description>A somewhat comprehensive list of the R packages that I have developed over the years.
plantecophysWebsite / CRAN / github
Analysis of leaf gas exchange. Fit A-Ci curves, simulate from the coupled leaf gas exchange model, fit Ball-Berry models of stomatal conductance, and more. Read open-access publication describing plantecophys.
fitplcWebsite / CRAN / github
Analysis and visualization of plant hydraulics data. Fit PLC curves to estimate P50 and related parameters, report uncertainty via bootstrap resampling, incorporate random effects, and more.</description>

      <title>Confidence intervals on predictions from mixed-effects models</title>

      <description>With simple linear regression, standard errors and confidence intervals for fitted (and predicted) values are easily computed. In R, we can use the se.fit argument in predict.lm, which returns the standard error for the fitted values, and interval = &amp;quot;confidence&amp;quot; to return confidence intervals. With linear mixed-effects models, however, it is not so easy. Neither predict.lme (from nlme) nor predict.merMod (from lme4) provide these methods, as confidence intervals on mixed-effects model predictions are harder to produce.</description>

      <description>We discussed a paper in journal club today (Tan et al. 2017), where three outliers were removed from a plot with just seven data points. The authors were happy to report a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.99. Here is their Fig. 2b (doesn’t matter what’s on the axes), where ‘outliers’ were labelled with open symbols.
What value of r do we expect between two normally distributed variables (where n=7), when we remove three points so that r is maximal?</description>

      <title>Four ways to make chloropleths in R</title>

      <description>Population of Australia by stateA powerful way to visualize spatial data is to colour the regions with the variable of interest. These sort of maps are called chloropleths. If you are visualizing data in the USA, you are quite lucky because the maps package, and even chloroplethr, can be used directly to make chloropleths. Outside of the USA, however, it is trickier and we have to do some manual work to prepare the files.</description>

      <title>Introducing the nlshelper package</title>

      <description>I recently organized a workshop on non-linear regression with R, covering the fundamentals and a few extras. When preparing the handout (which is available here as a PDF), I realized it is actually quite cumbersome to plot a fitted model with nls, together with the data. To make this process easier, I wrote a simple package - nlshelper - which does just that and a few other things. Read on for a simple demonstration, or visit the Github repository here, or read the full chapter in the link above.</description>

      <description>Together with Jeff Powell, I am teaching a new series of workshops in Advanced Topics in R this week. Follow the links below for each of the workshops. Also visit the informal page for the R course, and these workshops at .
Each of the pages hosts the handouts and other materials - all are available free of charge.

      <description>In this tutorial I show how to read data from online sources, in various ways. I will also demonstrate how to tidy data using the tidyr package, in particular converting from wide to long format.
Reading data files directlyIn the case where a csv or other text file is available as a direct link, we can simply read the file from the URL without having to download it. To read the current CO2 concentrations on Mauna Loa, for example, we can use the following:</description>
