									<h4>I am Remko Duursma, a freelance R trainer and consultant.</h4>

									<p>I am an experienced scientist and educator, and have been using R for all of my work since 2001. In my previous position as Associate Professor at Western Sydney University, Australia, I developed and taught an introductory R course. </p>
									
									
									<p>The course was very popular with a rating of 4.6/5 (191 responses), and attracted participants from all over Australia, including students and staff from universities, but also business and government. I have also taught many shorter workshops on advanced topics in R, as well as custom in-house R workshops, for example for the Australian Federal Police, and Forestry New South Wales.</p> 
									
									
									<p><strong>Responses to previous courses:</strong></p>
									
									<ul id="quotes" class="quotes">
										<li class="show">"The course was intense and extremely helpful!"<span>Anonymous student</span></li>
										<li>" The degree of freedom of the course also allow me to "subset" the subjects of the course, remain focused and receive help from experienced instructors.."<span>Jinyan Yang</span></li>
										<li>"I found this to be an excellent course which has equipped me to use R more proficiently. R has a huge and steep learning curve and this course has not only helped me to overcome this but I was also taught best practises and how to avoid certain pitfalls."<span>Petros Koulouris (Qantas, Australia). </span></li>
										<li>"The presenters know R by heart and have good experiences how to apply it in data analysis and visualization. The important thing, they are so patient and helpful whenever I have questions and have difficulties using R model. "<span>Titih</span></li>
										<li>"It's been a great week at the R course. The course is designed in such a way that people with different levels can make the most out of it. You can also do some of the examples using your own data, which means that you'll be able to use the same code later on in your real work. Awesome experience!"<span>Raul O. H.</span></li>
										<li>"I have historically used online self paced courses which are much inferior to this style of classroom/lab teaching. The instructors possessed a great knowledge of the R language and were able to teach it well."<span>Petros Koulouris (Qantas, Australia). </span></li>
										<li>"I've taken several online courses in R, but the intensiveness and focus of this course means that for the first time I feel confident that I can use R to analyse my own data."<span>Karen</span></li>
										<li>"Great set of workshops; material and lectures all very well done!"<span>Anonymous</span></li>

								<h3>Why R?</h3>
						
						<ul class="feature-icons3">
						
								<li class="fa-check">R has rapidly become one of the leading tools for data science. 
								When you need more control and flexibility in your analysis and visualizations than the usual point-and-click programs can offer, 
								R is the best alternative.</li>
								<li class="fa-check">Because R is the standard for statisticians, basically any statistical analysis is implemented and available in R.</li>
								<li class="fa-check">R is ranked the 8th most used programming language in the world, with over 2 million users. 
								This wide usership means you can find lots of help when you need it.</li>
								<li class="fa-check">In my experience, most newcomers to R who have never written code before can quickly learn how to use R.</li>
								<li class="fa-check">With R/Shiny, you can quickly develop powerful interactive apps and dashboards, without learning HTML, CSS or Javascript.</li>
								<li class="fa-check">Did I mention it is free?</li>
