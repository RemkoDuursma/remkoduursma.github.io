description: "My experience with the plumber package to deploy a REST service in R."
---



<p>I recently had the pleasure to complete an assessment - as part of a job interview. The assessment was enjoyable exactly because I did not have much - if any - experience with what I was supposed to be assessed on. But, at least for me, that’s the point: how quick can we learn new tools in the data science toolkit?</p>
<p>Unfortunately I am not going to share the actual assessment (or even some part of it), but will talk about the <code>plumber</code> package which I used to deploy an API.</p>
<p>The goal is to end up with a ‘REST’ service, which allows you to browse to a URL like this,</p>
<pre><code>&lt;server ip address&gt;:8001/api/items/nr123/predict</code></pre>
<p>where the IP address of the server is used, or 127.0.0.1 if you are running a ‘local host’. Here we communicate via port 8001 - but this could be any open port on your system/server. Your browser will then return some text output (perhaps : “prediction: 15”, if the service predicts the remaining lifetime of some item).</p>
<p>The <code>plumber</code> package can be used to quickly and effectively deploy this kind of API, all from the comfort of your R code.</p>
<div id="dynamic-routes" class="section level2">
<h2>Dynamic routes</h2>
<p>I am not going to repeat any of the introductory stuff of <a href="">the excellent plumber documentation</a>, just highlight some key points. We first make a file with the API definitions, using some special formatting. Suppose the file ‘item_predictor_api_definition.R’ contains the following:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#* Predict item lifetime
#* @param id
#* @get /prediction
function(item){
  
  my_prediction_function(item)
  
}</code></pre>
<p>Here we define a single API endpoint - but not quite in the format that we wish to have, because the request to this endpoint will have to look like this:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;server ip address&gt;:8001/prediction?item=&quot;nr123&quot;</code></pre>
<p>I suppose this is OK too, but a common recommendation is to allow a URL like <code>/api/item/nr123/prediction</code>. The key <code>nr123</code> (referring to some item ID) is therefore the dynamic bit of the URL. We can easily tell <code>plumber</code> what to do:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#* Predict item lifetime
#* @param id
#* @get /api/item/&lt;item&gt;/prediction
function(item){
  
  my_prediction_function(item)

}</code></pre>
<p>Note how the Roxygen field calls the parameter <code>id</code>, not <code>item</code> as you would expect. I found it necessary in plumber version 0.4.5 to <strong>not</strong> use the same name as the function argument there - otherwise the service crashes with a weird message (<a href="https://github.com/trestletech/plumber/issues/267">see this issue I openened</a>).</p>
</div>
<div id="deploy-time" class="section level2">
<h2>Deploy time!</h2>
<p>With our API endpoint defined (of course we can add as many as we like), we can start the API via:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(plumber)

# There are no other arguments besides a directory to find the file.
p &lt;- plumb(&#39;item_predictor_api_definition.R&#39;)

# Deploy!
p$run(port=8001)</code></pre>
<p>Your R process will now be busy (until you close it), with a message like:</p>
<pre><code>Starting server to listen on port 8001</code></pre>
<p>And so our work is done. Next, it makes sense to save the API deployment code in a script, let’s say it is called <code>item_predictor_deploy_api.R</code>. Then we can simply deploy our API from the command line with:</p>
<pre><code>Rscript item_predictor_deploy_api.R</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="supplying-command-line-arguments" class="section level2">
<h2>Supplying command line arguments</h2>
<p>Better yet, it would be neat to pass the port to open up as an argument in the command line. To do this, I used the <code>optparse</code> package which is a bit verbose in its usage, but super effective.</p>
<p>All we have to do is preface the API deploy script with some <code>optparse</code> code. We also want to make sure the user is told off when no port is defined (a potential security hazard).</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(optparse)

# Parse command line arguments and display help.
option_list = list(
  make_option(c(&quot;-p&quot;, &quot;--port&quot;), type=&quot;integer&quot;, default=NULL, 
              help=&quot;Port number for REST API&quot;, metavar = &quot;integer&quot;)
)

opt_parser &lt;- OptionParser(option_list=option_list,
                           description=&quot;Deploy API for item predictor.&quot;)
opt &lt;- parse_args(opt_parser)


# If the user does not supply the port - 
# fail with an error and a message, and display the help usage.
if(is.null(opt$port)){
  print_help(opt_parser)
  stop(&quot;Must supply port to open for REST API.&quot;,
       call. = FALSE)
}


# Now continue with the API.
library(plumber)

# Set the plumbing for the API.
p &lt;- plumb(&quot;R/api_definitions.R&quot;)

# Deploy.
# Note opt$port is the value read from the command line argument
p$run(port = opt$port)</code></pre>
<p>This is pretty neat because now we can do from the command line:</p>
<pre><code>Rscript item_predictor_deploy_api.R --port 8001</code></pre>
<p>This makes it very easy for your system admin to deploy this particular API on any port they wish, instead of needing to poke around in our code.</p>
<p>Also neat is what happens when the user does not define a port:</p>
<pre><code>Usage: item_predictor_deploy_api.R [options]
Deploy API for item predictor.

Options:
        -p INTEGER, --port=INTEGER
                Port number for REST API

        -h, --help
                Show this help message and exit


Error: Must supply port to open for REST API.
Execution halted</code></pre>
<p>We get not just an error message, but also a reminder how the script should be used. And all of this is outside R - this is a massive advantage when you are deploying a service for R-agnostics.</p>
</div>
<div id="conclusions" class="section level2">
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>Obviously this was no introduction to <code>plumber</code>, just a note on some settings I collected during my use of the package. The neat organization of the API definitions, and the code to deploy the API, together with <code>optparse</code> for command line options makes for an easy to use service to deploy a REST API.</p>
<p>For larger scale services, we of course wonder what happens if our single process we opened is busy - and another user sends a request. The <code>plumber</code> folks describe <a href="https://www.rplumber.io/docs/hosting.html#hosting">how Docker can be used for maintaining multiple processes, load balancing, etc.</a> Certainly something to try for next time.</p>
