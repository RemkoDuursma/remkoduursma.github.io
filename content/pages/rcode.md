I have been writing R code since 2001. Since a few years, a lot of this can be found on either <a href="https://www.github.com/remkoduursma"> github</a> or  <a href="https://www.bitbucket.org/remkoduursma"> bitbucket. 

Sometimes <a href="../post/">I write a blog</a> where I use R to solve unimportant (but nagging) problems. Topics include board games, the price of petrol in Sydney, or setting up an API for your R code.

Over the years <a href="../post/2017-11-10-rpackages.html">I have developed over a dozen R packages</a>, often implementing more challenging analytical methods with a nice R-friendly interface.

I used to teach an R course (and several advanced workshops) at Western Sydney University. I developed a lot of the material (and the website) on [www.hiercourse.com](www.hiercourse.com).
