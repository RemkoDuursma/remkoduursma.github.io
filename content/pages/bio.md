<img src="../img/tree_landscape_small.jpg" style="float: right; margin-left: 20px;"> <p>I am currently employed as a data sctientist at [Shint≈ç Labs](https://www.shintolabs.nl) and live in Almere, the Netherlands. We make data-driven web applications, as platforms for practical data science applications, mostly for government clients. My work involves writing interactive web applications (using [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [Shiny](https://www.r-project.org/), data interfaces, analytical and data visualization tools.</p> 

I also offer R Training & Consulting through my company <a href="https://datapelikaan.com/">DataPelikaan</a>. I offer customizable workshops from beginner to advanced level in R, on data analysis, programming, workflow & collaboration, and interactive web applications.  

Before moving back to the Netherlands in 2018, I was an Associate Professor at the <a href="https://www.westernsydney.edu.au/hie" target="_blank">Hawkesbury Institute for the Environment</a> (Western Sydney University), where I worked on models of vegetation function and structure, as support for global models of climate change impact. I worked daily with complex datasets arising from scientific field experiments, in <a href="https://www.westernsydney.edu.au/hie/stories/does_rising_carbon_dioxide_cause_australian_forests_to_grow_more_leaves" target="_blank">field</a> and glasshouse studies on climate change impacts on plants.  

I have written (or co-authored) many publications in the scientific literature. You can view a selection of them <a href="../pages/publications_select">here</a>, or browse the whole collection on <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qGSIWxcAAAAJ&hl=en">gscholar</a>. I have also written a lot of publicly available R code, <a href="../pages/rcode">summarized here</a>. 

<img style="float:left; margin-right:15px;" src="../img/windmill_small.jpg">In the nineties, I studied Forestry at Wageningen University. I quickly realized I enjoyed programming, and developing mathematical models, and customized my studies to include a lot of quantitative subjects. In 2000, I moved to <a href="https://www.uidaho.edu/" target="_blank">Idaho</a> (USA) to start on my PhD, where I developed a predictive model of forest growth, taking into account variations in the weather, forest attributes, and our understanding of tree physiology. In 2001 one of my supervisors suggested I learn the <a href="https://www.r-project.org/" target="_blank">R</a> language - a nerdy affair in those days. I was quickly hooked. From 2004 to 2008 I lived in Helsinki, Finland, where I worked as a post-doc on various models of tree and forest functioning.


<img style="float: right; margin-left:15px;" src="../img/banyan.png">In 2008 I moved to Sydney, Australia, to start as a post-doctoral researcher, investigating climate change effects on <a href="https://www.westernsydney.edu.au/hie/facilities/whole_tree_chambers" target="_blank">Eucalyptus trees</a>. The intended 2 year stay turned into a decade, with eventual promotion to Associate Professor. My tasks were to carry out and lead research projects, supervise PhD students, write publications and give presentations, and teach from time to time. I developed <a href="http://www.hiercourse.com" target="_blank">a popular R course</a> from scratch, and wrote a <a href="http://www.hiercourse.com/#two" target="_blank">300+ page manual</a> used also by other institutions. </p>
