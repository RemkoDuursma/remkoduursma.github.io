	I am a freelance R trainer and consultant, and live in Almere, the Netherlands. I moved back to the Netherlands in 2018, having been away for 18 years. 
	Most recently I was an Associate Professor at the <a href="https://www.westernsydney.edu.au/hie" target="_blank">Hawkesbury Institute for the Environment</a> (Western Sydney University), where I worked on models of vegetation function and structure, as support for global models of climate change impact. In practice I worked with lots of datasets, collected at <a href="https://www.westernsydney.edu.au/hie/stories/does_rising_carbon_dioxide_cause_australian_forests_to_grow_more_leaves" target="_blank">field</a> or glasshouse studies on climate change impacts on plants, and I coded. A lot.

I have written (or co-authored) many publications in the scientific literature. You can view a selection of them <a href="../pages/publications_select">here</a>, or browse the whole collection on <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qGSIWxcAAAAJ&hl=en">gscholar</a>. I have also written a lot of R code, <a href="../pages/rcode">summarized here</a>.

In the nineties, I studied Forestry at Wageningen University. I quickly realized I enjoyed programming, and developing mathematical models, and customized my studies to include a lot of quantitative subjects. In 2000, I moved to <a href="https://www.uidaho.edu/" target="_blank">Idaho</a> (USA) to start on my PhD, where I developed a predictive model of forest growth, taking into account variations in the weather, forest attributes, and our understanding of tree physiology. In 2001 one of my supervisors suggested I learn the <a href="https://www.r-project.org/" target="_blank">R</a> language - a nerdy affair in those days. I was quickly hooked. From 2004 to 2008 I lived in Helsinki, Finland, where I worked as a post-doc on various models of tree and forest functioning. </p>

In 2008 I moved to Sydney, Australia, to start as a post-doctoral researcher, investigating climate change effects on <a href="https://www.westernsydney.edu.au/hie/facilities/whole_tree_chambers" target="_blank">Eucalyptus trees</a>. The intended 2 year stay turned into a decade, with eventual promotion to Associate Professor. My tasks were to carry out and lead research projects, supervise PhD students, write publications and give presentations, and teach from time to time. I developed <a href="http://www.hiercourse.com" target="_blank">a popular R course</a> from scratch, and wrote a <a href="http://www.hiercourse.com/#two" target="_blank">300+ page manual</a> used also by other institutions. </p>
